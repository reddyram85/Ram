Hi,

As requested by you, I am ok to support with testing of the application to the Product owner or authority who are responsible for PROD testing. Where I have already performed multiple times the same for QA and UAT enviranment. 
However I am not responsible for PROD testing and I am not the authority to give or perform PROD testing. It is purely from Product owner side.

Please find the below information.

1) I am aware with full testing part as a tester but not worked as product owner so not aware about any specific action which they will take as per the project go-live or other responsibilities.
2) Even to PROD testing, Please provide prod login credentials and merchant cofigurations like NetBanking, cards , URL's or merchant information which need to share so that I can perform testing and provide the result.
3) We have know issues in QA those list along with if any production side issues will provide the result.

However any of the my result is only application functionality wise testing only, the Product owner testing might be different as may have any additional testing.
